# Addon contributors workshop

Thanks for participating in the Ember.js Addon Contributor's workshop!
In this repository, you will find materials that you should download and install today.
This will help reduce the wifi burden of many people npm installing at the same time.

```
git clone https://github.com/ember-learn/addon-contributors-workshop
cd addon-contributors-workshop
yarn install
```

If you do not yet have yarn, you can install it like this:

```
npm install -g yarn
```

If you are new to JavaScript or any of the above is confusing, please contact your workshop facilitators. They are happy to help you get started!

## Optional pre-workshop preparation

During the workshop, there will be time for you to try working on an addon of your choice. We'll provide a list of addons and issues to choose from, but if you already have an addon in mind that you would like to work on, go ahead and install it now too.

## Running your own workshop

If you would like to run your own workshop, you are welcome to reuse these materials! Contact the creators if you would like help or have questions.
