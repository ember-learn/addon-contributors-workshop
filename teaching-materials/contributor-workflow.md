# Contributor workflow

This document will walk you through the steps that many contributros take when working on an open source addon.

## Fork, download, install

From the [addon's page on GitHub](https://github.com/ember-learn/addon-contributors-workshop), click the "Fork" button in the top corner.
This will create your own fork (your own copy) of the addon. This is where you will be doing your work. From the fork page, now you can copy the link to clone the repo, just like you normally would:

```sh
git clone YOUR_REPO_URL
cd addon-contributors-workshop
yarn install
```

## Branch

It's easiest to manage the fork if you do your work on a branch, and not on the main branch:

```sh
git checkout -b my-branch-name
```

## Do your work and commit

TODO

## Push your work up to your fork

```
git push origin my-branch-name
```

## Run the tests, and add to them!

## See if you need to update the docs

## Open a Pull Request
