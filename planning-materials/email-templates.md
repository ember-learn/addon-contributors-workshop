## Request for addons to work on

Hello! Do you maintain any addons that you would like some volunteer help with? I'm running a workshop on DATE where developers will learn how to contribute to open source Ember addons. We are creating a list of addons and issues for people to try working on.

Can you send me the names of any addons that you think people could help with?

The week after the workshop, we'll follow up with addon maintainers to see if any help is needed to get the participants' PRs merged.

Thanks!

## Getting quotes from addon authors

Hello! I'm creating a workshop for people to learn about writing addons, and I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about your experience as an addon author/maintainer. We'll use these quotes during the workshop to encourage our participants to challenge themselves!

Feel free to pick one or two questions from this list (or more if you feel like it!)

- What motivates you to work on this addon?
- How did you first get involved as a maintainer/author?
- What advice would you give someone who is trying to help out in a project like yours?
- What kinds of things tend to be the greatest areas of need that contributors can help with?

Thank you!

## Volunteer emails

Hi! Thanks for volunteering to help with the workshop! This email will let you know what to expect.

The workshop begins at TIME on DATE at the Portland Convention Center, and it is helpful if you can arrive 20 mins early. Many of our participants arrive early as well. When you arrive, go to the check-in area, where you will find out which room our workshop is in.

This is a low-key event. The first half is a presentation and some live coding, done by the workshop leaders. The second half is unstructured open work time. There are two goals for volunteers:

1. Helping participants feel welcome! When you arrive, say hello, introduce yourself, and chat with the people at your table to break the ice.
2. During the open workshop time, help participants make progress on their PRs. This may include pairing, sharing useful links, asking if people have questions, showing an interest in what they are doing, and exploring together!

You are not expected to know all the answers or teach the group. However, if you have any useful information for the group during the presentation section, feel free to chime in! Sharing personal experiences helps bring a workshop (and open source) to life. 

If you have any questions, please get in touch!
